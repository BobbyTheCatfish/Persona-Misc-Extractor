# Misc Extractor

This project, largely based on [EvtTool](https://github.com/tge-was-taken/EvtTool), helps convert a bunch of file formats used in the Persona series.

## How to use
Drag a supported file on the executable to convert it to or from a JSON. Note that the filename *does* matter.

## Currently Supported
- ENV (Environment)
- CAR
- HTB (Hit Table)

### In Progress
- None at the moment

### Planned
To be determined. I'm just getting started.
